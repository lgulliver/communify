# Communify
An open source alternative to Meetup, that is free for both organisers and attendees.

# Goals

1. Provide an easy and joyful to use Meetup alternative
2. Provide open APIs for easy integration
3. Provide a reference microservice and micro front-end architecture to the community
4. Provide an easy way to deploy and configure the project

# Principles

1. Do no evil. No data that is collected should ever be able to be sold.

# Technologies

- Most services will likely be written in C# and built to be hosted in Azure Functions/other serverless technologies

# Other bits and bobs

This project serves as an opportunity to get to grips with serverless architectures, along with technologies such as Blazor and Github Actions.
